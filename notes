You first need to remove all the hardcoded things in my code, and the order in which you should do it is 1) loop function, 2) controller function, 3) argos setup file (XML)

1) Check crossroad_loop_footbot folder:
 a) CMakeLists, at the end you will see may paths (/home/ivan... something). Swich that to your local PC (you can look for the SO-s by using the linux locate function (sudo apt-get install locate, then updatedb, then locate something.so - I guess you know about that already)
 b) includes in the .h file

2) Check the crossroad_footbot_controller folder and apply the same steps as for 1.

3) Check the argos folder with the XML setup file. 
 a) You need to make sure that your .so-s are where you build them, mainly the controller libcrossroad_footbot_controller.so (step 2), and the loop function libcrossroad_loop_footbot.so (step 1). Loop function is the functin which executes after (or before) the main loop of the controller. 
 b) the image file path crossroad.png


? In case of error, make sure to get all the paths right. ARGOS_PLUGIN_PATH is the environment variable which needs to be pointed to the place where you have all the custom plugins. More about this is here: http://www.argos-sim.info/dev_manual.php
